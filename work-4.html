            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
             As part of the Human-Centered Design module in first year, I co-developed Swipe, a self-cleaning kitchen countertop designed for shared student kitchens. The project followed a human-centered design approach, combining field research, rapid prototyping, and iterative user validation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Faced with the widespread issue of poor hygiene in communal kitchens — identified by over 75% of students surveyed — we created a tangible solution to promote healthier cleaning habits. Swipe is a rotating, self-cleaning countertop module that reduces the effort needed to maintain cleanliness while encouraging a sense of shared responsibility. The result: cleaner kitchens, less social friction, and more students feeling confident to cook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our process included in-depth user research, interviews with hall staff, lo-fi and hi-fi prototyping, electronics testing, and real-world user trials. This journey led us to design a desirable product that addresses an overlooked but pressing issue in student life.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Swipe is more than a cleaning tool — it represents a vision of design as a driver of everyday change, tackling micro-conflicts in shared living environments. This project reinforced my commitment to practical, empathetic, and impact-oriented design.
